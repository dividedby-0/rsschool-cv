I will add my resume here, _I promise_.

No, really, give me some more time and I'll do it.

I will probably add a smaller header and a bullet list, like this:

#### Smaller header

- Something something experience
- Another experience
- More experience
- Experience FTW

Most likely I will also list all the courses I took with another small header, like:

#### Another small header

- Course 1
- Course 2
- Course 3
- I mean courses are good, no?
- Course 4

I'll do it, I promise. I just need some more time.

But hey, the GIT thing _works_.

That's what matters, no?
